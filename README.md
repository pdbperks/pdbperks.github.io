I have started using github's website provision because it offers a secure certificate and allows me to continue 
experimenting with advanced HTML5 features that are being blocked by modern browsers: this was particularly 
noticeable on iOS where Motion and Orientation Access was required.  
The github website feature only allows static code, so PHP is not an option, but I have revised some of my code to javascript
without loss of function.  
Since a lot of my content (Projects) described microcontroller experiments with code hosted on github anyway, 
this transition was a natural development.  I am currently reviewing and migrating my project blogs to this site.
